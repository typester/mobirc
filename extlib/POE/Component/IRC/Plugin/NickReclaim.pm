POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::NickReclaim - A PoCo-IRC plugin for reclaiming
your nickname

 use warnings;
 use POE qw(Component::IRC Component::IRC::Plugin::NickReclaim);
i
 my $nickname = 'Flibble' . $$;
 my $ircname = 'Flibble the Sailor Bot';
 my $ircserver = 'irc.blahblahblah.irc';

 my $irc = POE::Component::IRC->spawn( 
     nick => $nickname,
     server => $ircserver,

     ircname => $ircname,
 ) or die "Oh noooo! $!";

 POE::Session->create(
     package_states => [
         main => [ qw(_start) ],
     ],
 );

  $poe_kernel->run();

 sub _start {
     $irc->yield( register => 'all' );

     # Create and load our NickReclaim plugin, before we connect 
     $irc->plugin_add( 'NickReclaim' =>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::NickReclaim - A
L<POE::Component::IRC|POE::Component::IRC> plugin automagically deals with
your bot's nickname being in use and reclaims it when it becomes available
again.

It registers and handles 'irc_433' events. On receiving a 433 event it will
reset the nickname to the 'nick' specified with C<spawn> or C<connect>,
appendedwith an underscore, and then poll to try and change it to the
original nickname. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

Takes one optional argument:

B<'poll'>, the number of seconds between nick change attempts, default is 30;

Returns a plugin object suitable for feeding to
L<POE::Component::IRC|POE::Component::IRC>'s C<plugin_add> method.
